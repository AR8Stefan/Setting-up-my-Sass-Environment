# Setting up my SCSS Environment

- This Readme is to help me remember how to setup my SCSS environment.

Install Sass with Ruby:
```
gem install sass
```
#### Compile CSS to SCSS:
To compile your SCSS into CSS you need to let your Sass know where you are writing your code and give it a place to precompile the CSS into another file.

```
sass input.scss output.css
```

Link your new CSS file in your HTML.
```
<link href="output.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

- You can name your files whatever you'd like. The output css file should now contain all your pain CSS.
###### Remember to never work in the CSS file generated by your Sass

#### Watch command:
```
sass --watch /(inputfoldername:/(outputfoldername)
```
This command tells your Sass to recompile your ```.scss``` file to CSS when the file is saved.

#### Organising SASS:

- Create a new ```folder``` in your directory for your ```.scss``` files. It is best practice to name it ```scss```.
- Move the ```.scss``` file into your new folder.
- Create a new CSS folder and run the watch command for those folders.
```
sass --watch /(inputfoldername:/(outputfoldername)
```
- Remember to change the ```<link>``` tag in your HTML file.

#### Creating Partials:

- Create a new folder inside your ```scss``` folder called ```partials```.
- Next make a new file ```_newfile.scss``` or ```_colors.scss``` for example, inside the ```partials``` folder.
- Import the partials with ```@import``` at the top of your main SCSS file.
```
@import 'partials/main-styles,
        'partials/colors',
        'partials/variables,
        'partials/mixins,
        'partials/helpers;
```
