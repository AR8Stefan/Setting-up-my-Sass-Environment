# Setting up my SCSS Environment

Install Sass with Ruby:
```
gem install sass
```
#### Compile CSS to SCSS
To compile your SCSS into CSS you need to let your Sass know where you are writing your code and give it a place to precompile the CSS into another file.

```
sass input.scss output.css
```

Link your new CSS file in your HTML.
```
<link href="output.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

- You can name your files whatever you'd like. The output css file should now contain all your pain CSS.
##### Remember to never work in the CSS file generated by your Sass

Watch command:
```
sass --watch /(folder/file):/(folder/file)
```
